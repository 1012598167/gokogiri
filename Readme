A pretty straightforward and simple library for using
LibXML in native Go.

First, install Go and libxml on your system. You can google that
one yourself. You probably have libxml2 and since you are looking
for a Go lib, assumedly you have that too.

Then, we are using the build tool called "gb". You can get install
instructions from here: http://code.google.com/p/go-gb/

So, to build the project, just go to the root directory and type

    $> gb

Then, to run the tests:

    $> gb -t
    
And finally, to install it...

    $> sudo -E gb -i
    
Note: The -E flag is needed if your GO_PATH is not exported automatically to the root user. So, setting -E makes sure it is!
