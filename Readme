GoXML 
by Hampton Catlinâ„¢

A pretty straightforward and simple library for using
LibXML in native Go.

First, install Go and libxml on your system. You can google that
one yourself. You probably have libxml2 and since you are looking
for a Go lib, assumedly you have that too.

Secondly, just run "make install" and it should build itself.

Also, if you don't want to do active development, just run...

    goinstall goxml
